\chapter{Acknowledgements} % this needs to be before \mainmatter.
A lot of people are awesome. Probably your family, friends, 
advisor, and that one super special high school teacher who
believed in you.

% Starts proper arabic numbering of pages and chapters.
\mainmatter

\chapter{Introduction}
Your first chapter is probably an introduction. But who knows. Check out Eq.\ (\ref{that_right_triangle_rule})!
Note that after Eq.\ and Fig.\ you want to use `.\textbackslash'  to use a single sized space. Otherwise,
latex will interpret it as the end of a sentence and put additional white space in between `Eq.' and 
`(\ref{that_right_triangle_rule})'.

\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \label{that_right_triangle_rule}
\end{equation}

\chapter{A new chapter}
Your second chapter probably has novel material in it. hopefully.

% Add additional \chapter{}s as necessary.

% use \cite{} to cite a reference in your bibliography file.
% use \ref{} to reference a \label{} from an equation, figure, or table.

% for sets of equations use align or gather:
%\begin{align}
%\end{align}

% for long equations, use multline.

% for figures:
%\begin{figure}[ht]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{name_of_figure.eps}
%\caption{A caption! \label{a_figure}}
%\end{figure}

% for tables:
%\begin{table}
%\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
% 1 & 2 & 3 \\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\caption{Another caption! \label{a_table}}
%\end{table}

% Only call appendix once, here.
\appendix

\chapter{Stuff}
If you need an appendix, it will go here.

\begin{align}
a^n + b^n &\ne c^n \\
n &> 2
\end{align}

\chapter{More stuff}
A second appendix. Look at you, you over achiever.

% Any chapters such as End Notes go after this.
\backmatter

\bibliography{name_of_your_bibtex_file}
% for your own sake, use a bibtex file, so all of the numbering of references will be done
% automatically.
